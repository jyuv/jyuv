Here I share some algorithmic projects of mine and other things that some of you may find helpful and useful.

If you are interested in graphs and distributed algorithms, you might wanna check out the series of blogposts I made. The posts are covering a paper suggesting a sub-linear algorithm to form an MST from a graph. They are written in order to provide a deep intuitive dive into the paper, focusing mainly on the intuition and the algorithmic ideas and reasoning, rather than rather than presenting long rigorous proofs. The first post in the series is accessible <a href="https://medium.com/@jacobyyuval/an-efficient-distributed-mst-intro-7f369d2cc222">here.</a>
